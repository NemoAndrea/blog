title: Working with PDB files in Blender
---

In this article, I will go over about how I go about loading pdb structures into blender. 

Blender is freely available software that will run on Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. It is intendend for complex 3D animation 
and rendering. Because of this, Blender has every possible option you could imagine for creating renders that fit your needs. 
The downside is that it will have a steep learning curve. 

Since I like molecular biology, I figured I should try to import protein structures which are deposited at the 
[RSCB Protein DataBase](https://www.rcsb.org/) (PDB for short). With the recent new version of blender (2.8) 
rendering can now be done in realtime, which is a huge boost to user friendlyness and ease of operation. Luckily, I had this [blog post by Damien Farrell](https://dmnfarrell.github.io/bioinformatics/proteins-blender) to serve as a starting point.
